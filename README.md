# AmINormal

AmINormal is a simple library to check if you are normal. This library provides a function that randomly returns "yes" or "no" along with funny motivational quotes.

## Installation

To install AmINormal, add the package to your project using the NuGet Package Manager:

```sh
dotnet add package AmINormal
```

Or, add it directly to your project file:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="AmINormal" Version="1.0.0" />
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the AmINormal library:

```csharp
using AmINormal;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var result = NormalChecker.IsNormal();
        Console.WriteLine($"Am I normal? {result}");
    }
}
```

This will output something like:

```
Am I normal? Yes! Keep going, you're doing great!
```

## Development

To build the project locally, ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. Then, run the following commands:

```sh
dotnet clean
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet pack -c Release
```
